# Neutrino Mass Matrix Research Project

This project focuses on computational analysis of neutrino mass matrices in the context of Seesaw and Inverse Seesaw mechanisms. 

## Project Context
- Use NumPy for matrix operations and linear algebra
- Use SymPy for symbolic mathematics when dealing with parameters
- Follow physics conventions for neutrino mass ordering and mixing angles
- Use standard parameterizations for PMNS matrix elements
- Include proper error handling for matrix diagonalization routines
- Maintain clear separation between Seesaw Type I, II, III and Inverse Seesaw mechanisms
- Document all physical assumptions and approximations used in calculations

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect physics concepts (e.g., `mass_matrix`, `mixing_angles`, `neutrino_masses`)
- Include docstrings with physics context and mathematical definitions
- Add comments explaining the physical significance of calculations
- Use SI units unless otherwise specified in physics literature conventions
